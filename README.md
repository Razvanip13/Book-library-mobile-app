It was my laboratory project for the "Mobile development" course in my 3rd year of University

I always wanted to have an app where I can keep with the book I read (something similar to "Good reads"). 
The app is build in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose and Room. 
The architecture is repsecting the MVVM guidlines. 
A REST API was build in Java Springboot to demonstrate that it can communicate with a server (in a local area network)
